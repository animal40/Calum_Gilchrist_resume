        <h2>About me</h2>
        <!-- This is just a copy of my LinkedIn about me section, if this is
        ever going to be used for something I will edit it -->

        <P>After completing my BSc in Architecture, following in the footsteps of my grandfather, I made the decision that this was not the career path I wished to pursue.</P>
        
        <P>From here I made the move into Education. Inspired by my favourite teachers from school and a belief I could pass on my knowledge and skills with the same enthusiasm that they showed me, I undertook my Post Graduate degree in Secondary Education (Design & Technology). 
        I have enjoyed my career in education and have added to and built upon my skillset over the past 10 years in this career:</P>
        <ul>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Leadership</li>
        <li>Planning and Organisation</li>
        <li>Presentation skills</li>
        <li>Problem Solving</li>
        <li>Resourcefulness</li>
        <li>Working in a Team</li>
        <li>Working Independently</li>
        </ul>
        <P>I have reached a stage in my Education career where I don't feel as challenged as I would like to and do not see a progression route which I wish to pursue.</P>
        
        <P>This is why I have undertaken a Software Engineering Bootcamp; to set myself a new challenge and push myself to become stimulated by my work as I am in other aspects of my life; family and hobbies.
        I have chosen to pursue Software Engineering as coding and putting together my own websites when I was younger was something I really enjoyed doing, and after undertaking a 5 day coding challenge my mind was made up.
        I applied to Hyperion Dev, who are linked with University of Edinburgh, and I was able to apply for and secure funding for the course through the Scottish Funding Council.
        I am loving the course and how much it challenges me and also how much I have learned within a short space of time.</P>
        
        <P>On the bootcamp I have learned:</P>
        <ul>
        <li>how to build applications as a software engineer</li>
        <li>about Object Oriented Programming and agile development</li>
        <li>programing languages: Java and Python</li>
        </ul>
        <P>It has been a challenge to balance the course, a full-time job, family life and hobbies, but one I have relished as my goal is to better my life by changing career.</P>
